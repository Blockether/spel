# Specs

This directory contains test plans generated by the spel-test-planner agent.

## Usage

1. Ask the planner to explore your app and create a plan:
   ```
   @spel-test-planner Create test plan for the login flow at http://localhost:8080
   ```

2. Plans are saved as `<feature>-test-plan.md` files in this directory.

3. Pass plans to the generator to create test code:
   ```
   @spel-test-generator Generate tests from test-e2e/specs/login-test-plan.md
   ```

4. If tests fail, ask the healer to fix them:
   ```
   @spel-test-healer Fix failing tests in test/e2e/
   ```
